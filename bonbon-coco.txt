Combine chocolate, sugar and salt in a heavy cooking pot. Add the water; slowly bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Continue to cook for about twenty minutes, or until coconut mixture is thick and all liquid has evaporated. The coconut will begin to brown; mixture will be stiff and sticky. Remove from heat. Form coconut mixture into balls. Place balls on a sheet of waxed paper; flatten by placing a second sheet of waxed paper on top and pressing down. Set aside to cool completely before removing waxed paper. The balls should be firm but not crunchy. Serve.
